  preamble: `END USER LICENSE AGREEMENT
NovAura Market Commercial License v2.0

IMPORTANT: THIS IS A LEGALLY BINDING CONTRACT. PLEASE READ CAREFULLY.

By purchasing, downloading, installing, or using this Asset, you acknowledge that you have 
read, understood, and agree to be bound by the terms of this Agreement.`,

  royaltyTiersExplanation: `
SECTION 1: ROYALTY TIER SYSTEM

NovAura Market uses a graduated royalty system based on the type and scope of assets:

• 1% - Music & Audio License
  For music, soundtracks, and audio when used as the primary sonic identity of your game.
  This applies when a single creator's music defines the majority of your game's soundtrack,
  background ambience, or audio experience. Designed to fairly compensate musicians while
  keeping costs manageable for developers.

• 3% - Individual Art License
  For single sprites, textures, and artwork used as components in your project 
  alongside other assets.

• 10% - Collection License  
  When multiple assets from the same creator collectively define your game's primary
  visual style, character aesthetic, or comprehensive audio identity. This applies when 
  the creator's work is the dominant artistic influence on your game's look or sound.

• 10% - Game Integration License: When your assets heavily define the project's identity (e.g., used in over 50% of scenes, core character sprites).
• 15% - Functional Sub-Game License: For barebone logic templates and mechanics alongside assets.
• 20% - Full Source License: For entire game templates or major frameworks where you provide the underlying code/architecture. 

These royalties are automatically tracked and dispersed. Buyers MUST attribute your work if specified in your attached EULA terms.

• 0% - Open Source License
  MIT/Apache licensed assets requiring only attribution, no monetary royalties.

The appropriate tier is selected by the creator at time of upload and is binding.`,

  royaltyClause: (percentage: number, creatorName: string) => `
SECTION 2: YOUR ROYALTY OBLIGATION (${percentage}%)

YOU AGREE TO PAY ${percentage}% OF ALL GROSS COMMERCIAL REVENUE GENERATED FROM PRODUCTS 
OR SERVICES THAT INCORPORATE THIS ASSET.

Royalty Calculation:
• Gross Revenue = Total revenue before any deductions (platform fees, taxes, refunds)
• Royalty Rate = ${percentage}% of Gross Revenue
• Payment Due = Quarterly, within 30 days of quarter end (Jan 30, Apr 30, Jul 30, Oct 30)
• Currency = USD or equivalent at time of payment
• Minimum Payment = No minimum; all revenue subject to royalty

Example Calculation:
If your product generates $100,000 in gross revenue, you owe:
$100,000 × ${percentage}% = $${(100000 * percentage / 100).toLocaleString()} in royalties

Perpetual Obligation:
This royalty obligation continues for as long as the Asset remains integrated into your 
commercial product, even if you cease active development. The obligation survives license 
termination for revenue earned during the license period.

Payment Method:
Royalties must be paid directly to ${creatorName} via the payment method specified in the 
Asset documentation or as agreed upon in writing. NovAura Market may provide payment 
processing services but is not responsible for ensuring payment.`,

  collectionClause: `
SECTION 3: COLLECTION LICENSE SPECIFIC TERMS (10%)

When using the Collection License tier, the following additional terms apply:

Dominant Aesthetic Threshold:
The 10% royalty rate applies when assets from a single creator constitute the majority 
of your game's visual or audio identity. This includes:

• All or most character art from one artist
• The complete visual style defined by one creator's assets
• The majority of music/sound from one composer's collection
• A cohesive art pack that defines your game's look

Multiple Asset Calculation:
If you use multiple assets from the same creator under Collection License:
• The 10% rate applies to ALL revenue from the product
• You cannot separate revenue by individual asset
• The obligation is per-creator, not per-asset

Attribution Requirements:
Collection License requires prominent attribution including:
• In-game credits with creator's name
• On store pages and marketing materials
• In source code comments (if source distributed)`,

  frameworkClause: `
SECTION 4: FRAMEWORK LICENSE SPECIFIC TERMS (15%)

When using the Framework License tier, the following additional terms apply:

Framework Definition:
A Framework is reusable code, systems, or templates that provide core functionality:

• Game systems (card games, battle systems, crafting, inventory)
• UI/HUD frameworks and component libraries
• Physics engines and simulation systems
• Networking/multiplayer frameworks
• Tooling and editor extensions

Derivative Works:
When building upon a Framework:
• Your modifications remain subject to the 15% royalty
• The obligation applies to the entire product using the framework
• You may not resell the framework itself as a standalone product

Attribution in Code:
Framework License requires:
• Copyright notices preserved in source code
• Attribution in documentation
• Link to original framework in about/credits section`,

  auditRightsClause: `
SECTION 5: AUDIT RIGHTS

4. Timeline:
   • Audit request must be made in writing
   • You must provide documentation within 30 days
